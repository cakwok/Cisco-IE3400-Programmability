# Cisco-IE3400-Programmability

In this code, we explored the programmability of the Cisco IE 3400 industrial switch through RESTful API operations. This effort sets the groundwork for future functionalities, for example the streamlined provisioning of cyber vision sensors within industrial settings.
<br/><br/><br/>
Through the web interface with RESTful API calling, a field user can 
- observe the current switchports' admin and operational status
- manage a switchport's administrative status
- observe the Cyber Vision sensor status.
