# Cisco-IE3400-Programmability

In this code, we explored the programmability of the Cisco IE 3400 industrial switch through RESTful API operations. This effort sets the groundwork for future functionalities, for example the streamlined provisioning of cyber vision sensors within industrial settings.

Through the web interface with RESTful API calling, a field user can manage a switchport's administrative status, and observe the Cyber Vision sensor status.
